# Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Electroencephalography Data for the Prediction of Major Psychiatric Disorders

Major Psychiatric Disorder (MPD) significantly affects mental health, resulting in alterations in cognitive functions and behavior.
Therefore, it is crucial to predict and identify the illness precisely. This study evaluates the effectiveness of Machine Learning
(ML) methods in improving the accuracy of predicting and diagnosing Major Psychiatric Disorder (MPD) by examining past
medical records, psychological assessments, and resting-state Electroencephalography (EEG) data. The utilized techniques
include logistic regression, Elastic Net (EN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost). The findings suggest that the
Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) exhibits exceptional performance, especially in the context of schizophrenia, with an
accuracy rate of 94%. The ensemble approaches that combine Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting
Machine (LGBM) produce accuracy rates of up to 96% and 94%, outperforming existing algorithms in terms of accuracy and
reliability, particularly for schizophrenia, adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The results highlight the
capability of integrating Electroencephalography (EEG) data with sophisticated Machine Learning (ML) approaches for
accurately diagnosing Major Psychiatric Disorder (MPD). The objective is to enhance psychiatric diagnostics and develop more
efficient diagnostic instruments, leading to prompt and precise treatments and enhanced treatment approaches for psychiatric
disorders.
